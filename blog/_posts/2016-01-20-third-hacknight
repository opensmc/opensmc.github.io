Tonight was OpenSMC's third hacknight.

OpenGov has graciously offered OpenSMC a beautiful meeting space starting with our Feb 2ed hacknight.

OpenSMC is co-sponsoring two upcoming Hackday events:

* Code Across March 5th Open Data day

* San Mateo County's HackSMC2 on May 21st

Exact locations and times TBA.

A lot of interesting progress was made on our projects:

The Flu clinic mobile app team worked at setting up their Cordova development environment to build the apps.

Web team turned on the OpenSMC web site.  A Jekyll based web site hosted on github pages.

Jessica Parsons gave a short discussion on using markdown in OpenSMC web pages.

The leadership team worked start-up issues: email, slack membership and general scheduling.

We are looking forward to our next hacknight next week.
