title:  "OpenSMC hacknight - we are getting our groove on"

Tonight's hacknight again was the core team working steadily on our projects.  Several core members could not make it.  That did not stop the team from working on our projects.  We worked on some tools issues: using git branches and installing Python3.  A comfortable work groove.

Hack-SMC is coming up.  We talked about projects we could submit and being subject matter experts.  We think several of our projects can be entered.

CycleSMC picked up steam.  We have the CyclePhilly team lead working with us, setting up the back end for the County's transportation (sustainability?) team.  We have a solid start on rebranding of the Android app to CycleSMC and we build the IOS app.  It would be really cool if we could get it working by May's bike month.  A new member is looking at helping us with OpenSMC specific graphics.  Thank you team!

A new, hopefully quick project was started.  LocalFreeWeb.  This is a rebranding of the Code for SF app that allows you to text a bus stop number and get back the 3 nearest free Internet capable computers.  Typically local libraries.  This should be straight forward.  We have the SamTrans bus stop dataset and the county wide libraries data set.  There is no app, just an API gateway.  You simply text a number to the SMC LocalFreeWeb phone number.  I am thinking we could have a second number that would give you the 3 nearest free public WiFi locations.

We had a returning member who is working on ADA reporting issues.  He wants to work on providing a way for ADA people to report problems.  We talked about SeeClickFix.  My mother used a walker and there was broken pavement nearby that she had a hard time getting over.  It would have been nice if she could have used an app or a web form to report this problem and get it fixed.  This is what "civic hacking" is all about.

Keep calm, code on,
